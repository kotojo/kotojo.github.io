      <p>PieceAPC is for people to be able to create personal computer builds, show them to the user base, and be rated on to find out the quality of their builds. You could search through Newegg's computer parts data to find parts, then add them all together into one build, which would tell you the cost of the total build. All computers were able to be seen by the entire user base, searched by rating or price, and rated upon with an upvote or downvote.</p>
